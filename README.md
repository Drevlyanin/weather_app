This is a full-fledged Python and Django application that allows users to obtain information about weather conditions in various cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The application is built using Django and employs the Jinja template engine, Bootstrap modules, and HTML pages. The program involves creating migrations, setting up a database, and importing third-party libraries. The development was done using PyCharm.

To use the application, the user simply inputs the name of a city and the application retrieves the current weather conditions for that city from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The application provides weather information such as temperature, description in real-time.
